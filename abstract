Abstract. IOT, machine economy, automation are hot topics at the moment. 
Systems and protocols without centralised ownership are very useful in this field,
in particular token systems. Even though blockchains probably aren't a magic fix 
to IOT security, stateful systems such as Ethereum provide a pretty good platform
to automate actions where otherwise trust would be needed creating decentralised organisations 
of different degree of autonomy.
All that requires not just theoretical work, but real life prototyping. 
We propose to create an semi-autonomous fully automated bar in Berlin, an experiment that can accomodate
different pilot projects and foster cryptoeconomic design practice. Ponzi Bar is based on
Automaten Bar concept that existed in Berlin, adding a system of tokens to manage access, 
value exchange and governance, implemented on Ethereum. 
This document describes basic architecture, participants roles, some functional specifications 
and a roadmap.
More detailed technical specifications will be described in the separate document.
